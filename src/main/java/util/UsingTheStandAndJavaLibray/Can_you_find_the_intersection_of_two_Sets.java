   * Surprisingly (kinh ngac), many operations you would expect(du doan) to see on the Set interface are not there:
   * There is no clear way when dealing with Sets to perform a union (phep ho'p logic), subtraction,
   * or difference without modifying the provided Set.
   * 
   * The Collection interface provides the addAllmethod to perform a union, removeAllfor difference,
   * and retainAllfor (retain: giu lai) intersection.
   * All of these methods modify the collection on which you called the method
   * 
   * An alternative is to use the Sets class from Guava. This is a class with several static methods for manipulating sets.
